            You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy.
             For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create 
             and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search
              results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or
               without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching
                YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode,
                 like Chrome Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your
                 privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.
